# Workshop Description

In the past 50 years, supercomputers have achieved what was once considered only possible in Sci-Fi movies.
The key to the tremendous success of supercomputers has been a combination of outstanding architectures plus software that uses all the available resources and makes parallelization possible.
This secret sauce has led to different implementations across fields.
Scientists typically rely on three main programming interfaces: OpenMP for shared memory computers, CUDA for GPU computing, and MPI for distributed memory computers.
MPI in particular is essential to be able to achieve performance on systems with millions of nodes.
This workshop explores the key features of these three approaches, explaining their underlying philosophy and how they leverage the different computer architectures.
The final goal is to give the student a taste of the different programming paradigms and the tools to decide which is the best approach.

Professor Eric Darve received his Ph.D.
in Applied Mathematics at the Jacques-Louis Lions Laboratory, in the Pierre et Marie Curie University, Paris, France.
His advisor was Prof. Olivier Pironneau, and his Ph.D. thesis was entitled "Fast Multipole Methods for Integral Equations in Acoustics and Electromagnetics."
He was previously a student at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure, rue d'Ulm, Paris, in Mathematics and Computer Science.
Prof. Darve became a postdoctoral scholar with Profs.
Moin and Pohorille at Stanford and NASA Ames in 1999 and joined the faculty at Stanford University in 2001.
He is a member of the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering.
